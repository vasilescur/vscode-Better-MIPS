# Better MIPS Support

## Features
This VSCode extension provides better MIPS colorization and snippets support.

## Color Theme
The extension comes with a color theme called `Nord MIPS`, based on the very popular [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) color pallete / theme.

## Note:
To disable the snippets, add this to `settings.json`:

```json
"[mips]": {
    "editor.snippetSuggestions": "none"
}
```

The extension is based on [this](https://github.com/kdarkhan/vscode-mips-support) one.
