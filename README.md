# Better MIPS Support

## Features
This VSCode extension provides better MIPS colorization and snippets support.

## Colors
The extension comes with a color theme called `Nord MIPS`, based on the very popular [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) color pallete / theme.

The extension is based on [this](https://github.com/kdarkhan/vscode-mips-support) more limited one.
